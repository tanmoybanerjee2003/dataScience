## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>
This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. Purpose of the project is to build a supervised binary classifier to predict risk associated with loans.</br>
As part of the project,
1. Data related to loan applications from [Home Credit](http://www.homecredit.net/) has been analyzed, sanitized, encoded, scaled
2. A number of classifiers have been evaluated
3. Best performed classifier has been optimized further in multiple ways</br>


## File Description <a name="files"></a>
1. **Loan_default_risk_classfier.ipynb**: Notebook containing the work for the project. </br>
2. **Loan_default_risk_classfier.html**: HTML version of the notebook. </br>
3. **data/loan_applications_data.zip**: Winzip archive containing CSV data and schema of data from Home Credit. </br>
4. **images/confusion_matrix.png**: Image of confusion matrix that has been used in the notebook. </br>
5. **images/ROC_AUC.png**: Image of ROC AUC that has been used in the notebook. </br>


## Instructions <a name="instructions"></a>
1. Unzip the archive under 'data' folder and placed those two CSV files under that 'data' folder only.
2. Run the Jupyter notebook again, if you want. Else, you can refer to corresponding HTML to see existing output.
 

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code has been mentioned in Jupyter notebook and corresponding HTML file.
Same findings have been explained at the **Medium blog post** [here](My blog link once written)
