## Project Motivation <a name="motivation"></a>

This is an Udacity Nanodegree project. As part of the project, I found answers to following questions:</br>
1. What are the most common programming languages, databases, platforms, technologies and tools used across the world in 2019? </br>
2. What are the most popular programming languages in India? </br>
3. What is the salary earned on average for each programming language? </br>
In the process, I have analyzed data from Stackoverflow Annual Developer Surveys.

## File Description <a name="files"></a>

**Project4_DS_blog.ipynb**: Notebook containing the data analysis. </br>
**Project4_DS_blog.html**: HTML version of the notebook. </br>
**survey_2017.zip**: Winzip Archive containing CSV data and schema of Stackoverflow's 2017 Annual Developer Survey. </br>
**survey_2018.zip**: Winzip Archive containing CSV data and schema of Stackoverflow's 2018 Annual Developer Survey. </br>
**survey_2019.zip**: Winzip Archive containing CSV data and schema of Stackoverflow's 2019 Annual Developer Survey. </br>

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Main code is Jupyter notebook. This notebook needs Anaconda distribution of Python. The code should run with Python versions 3.x. </br>
This notebook uses following libraries:</br>
1. pandas </br>
2. numpy </br>
3. matplotlib </br>
4. seaborn </br>

Before running the notebook, please unzip each of the Winzip archives and place CSV data and corresponding schema at same folder of the Jupyter notebook.

## Results <a name="results"></a>
The main findings of the code has been mentioned in Jupyter notebook and corresponding HTML file.
Same findings have been explained at the post [here](https://medium.com/@tanmoybanerjee2003/what-technologies-and-languages-should-we-learn-and-help-us-earn-in-2020-2adfa5716a5c)
